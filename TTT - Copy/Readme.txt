Tic Tac Toe in C++ game which I created while taking the Codecademy course online. 

I made most of the code myself but with the basic knowledge I had I had to get some ideas from the codecademy's solution. What I didn't know was that it can work with functions that
are not using parameters, which surprised me. 

I thought I could add a function that tracks the score. 

I practiced with creating the values used as arrays, vectors or as a string. I thiught that a vector would be a bigger challenge than string, so I went with it.
